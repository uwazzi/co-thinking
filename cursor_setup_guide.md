# Using Cursor Custom Mode for Co-Thinking Research

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Configure Cursor Custom Mode
1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Go to "Features" â†’ "Custom Instructions"
3. Copy the content from `cursor_custom_mode.md` into the custom instructions box
4. Enable "Apply to all conversations"

### 2. Reference Foundation Documents
In your conversations with Cursor, you can:

**Upload PDFs directly**: Drag and drop your foundation PDFs into the chat
**Reference files**: Use `@fundations/[filename]` to reference specific documents
**Ask context-aware questions**: The custom mode will help interpret responses through your research lens

### 3. Sample Research Queries

Try these prompts to explore co-thinking foundations:

```
"Based on the foundation documents, what are the key psychological mechanisms of co-thinking with AI in learning contexts?"

"How would Ethan Mollick's framework apply to measuring student-AI collaboration effectiveness?"

"What measurement instruments would capture the trust dynamics described in our foundation documents?"

"Design a pilot study protocol based on the human-centered AI principles in our sources."
```

### 4. Iterative Research Development

Use this workflow:
1. **Explore**: Ask broad questions about psychological foundations
2. **Focus**: Narrow down to specific educational contexts
3. **Operationalize**: Convert insights into measurable variables
4. **Design**: Create specific research protocols
5. **Refine**: Iterate based on Cursor's suggestions

### 5. Document Your Research Process

Create research memos using this template:

**Research Question**: [Your specific question]
**Foundation Source**: [Which document/author]
**Key Insights**: [What you learned]
**Measurement Ideas**: [How to study this]
**Next Steps**: [What to explore next]

### 6. Maintain Alignment with Learning

**Weekly Alignment Check:**
- Review new insights from research activities
- Update cursor custom mode with emerging findings
- Revise research questions based on discoveries
- Integrate new psychological constructs or measurement approaches

**Update Cursor Mode When:**
- Pilot data reveals unexpected patterns
- New theoretical connections emerge
- Measurement instruments need refinement
- Foundation document insights get reinterpreted through new evidence

**Sample Alignment Prompts:**
```
"Based on my recent pilot data showing [finding], how should I update my understanding of co-thinking mechanisms?"

"I've discovered [insight] - how does this connect to Mollick's framework and what should I investigate next?"

"My measurement of [construct] isn't working as expected. Given the foundation documents, what alternative approaches should I consider?"
```

## Simple Implementation for Education Research

### Phase 1: Foundational Exploration (Week 1-2)
- Upload all three PDFs to Cursor
- Ask questions about co-thinking definitions and mechanisms
- Create a concept map of key psychological constructs
- Identify measurement approaches from literature

### Phase 2: Research Design (Week 3-4)
- Use Cursor to help design survey instruments
- Develop interview protocols
- Create behavioral coding schemes
- Plan pilot study logistics

### Phase 3: Pilot Implementation (Week 5-8)
- Test measurement tools with small student group
- Use Cursor to help analyze preliminary data
- Refine instruments based on feedback
- Document lessons learned

This approach lets you leverage your foundation documents without complex technical setup while maintaining rigorous social research standards.
