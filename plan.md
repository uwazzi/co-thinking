# Co-Thinking Agent Simulation Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated co-thinking agent simulation system designed to study human-AI collaborative intelligence patterns. The system focuses on analyzing psychological constructs, learning behaviors, and adaptive reasoning in human-AI interactions.

## Core Objectives
1. **Simulate Co-Intelligence Scenarios**: Create realistic human-AI collaborative environments
2. **Analyze Psychological Constructs**: Study decision-making, learning patterns, and cognitive processes
3. **Data-Driven Insights**: Collect and analyze interaction data for research purposes
4. **Adaptive Agent Behavior**: Implement agents that learn and adapt based on user interactions
