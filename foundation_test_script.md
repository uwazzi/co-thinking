# Foundation Document Test Script

## Quick 5-Minute Foundation Verification Test

Run this monthly to ensure your foundation documents are actively guiding your research:

### Step 1: Cursor Foundation Knowledge Test

**Copy these prompts into cursor one by one:**

```
Test 1: "What are the key differences between Mollick's co-intelligence approach and traditional AI tool usage?"

Test 2: "According to my Swiss AI foundation document, what ethical principles should guide my education research?"

Test 3: "How does The People Factor document suggest measuring human-centered AI success?"

Test 4: "Integrate insights from all three foundation documents to critique this research question: 'Do students perform better with AI assistance?'"
```

### Step 2: Score Cursor's Responses

**For each response, score 0-3 points:**

- **0 points**: Generic AI response, no foundation document reference
- **1 point**: Mentions documents but lacks specific details
- **2 points**: Uses specific concepts from documents accurately
- **3 points**: Integrates multiple document insights with specific examples

**Total Score: ___/12**

**Interpretation:**
- **10-12 points**: Excellent foundation integration ‚úÖ
- **7-9 points**: Good foundation use, minor improvements needed ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **4-6 points**: Moderate foundation use, needs attention üîÑ
- **0-3 points**: Poor foundation integration, immediate action required ‚ùå

### Step 3: Foundation Document Usage Audit

**Answer YES/NO for this week:**

**Mollick's Co-Intelligence:**
- [ ] YES/NO: Did I reference specific Mollick frameworks this week?
- [ ] YES/NO: Did Mollick's ideas influence a research decision?
- [ ] YES/NO: Can I name 2 specific concepts I used from Mollick?

**Swiss AI White Paper:**
- [ ] YES/NO: Did I apply Swiss AI principles this week?
- [ ] YES/NO: Did Swiss AI ethics shape my research approach?
- [ ] YES/NO: Can I name 2 specific Swiss AI guidelines I followed?

**The People Factor:**
- [ ] YES/NO: Did I use People Factor measurement approaches?
- [ ] YES/NO: Did People Factor influence my research methods?
- [ ] YES/NO: Can I name 2 specific People Factor concepts I applied?

**Foundation Usage Score: ___/9 YES answers**

**Interpretation:**
- **8-9 YES**: Excellent foundation integration ‚úÖ
- **6-7 YES**: Good foundation use ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **4-5 YES**: Moderate foundation use üîÑ
- **0-3 YES**: Poor foundation integration ‚ùå

### Step 4: Research Question Foundation Traceability

**For your current main research question, complete this:**

**My Research Question**: [Write it here]

**Foundation Traceability:**
- **Mollick Connection**: [How does this relate to Mollick's framework?]
- **Swiss AI Connection**: [How does this reflect Swiss AI principles?]
- **People Factor Connection**: [How does this use People Factor approaches?]

**Can you trace your research question back to at least 2 foundation documents?**
- [ ] YES ‚úÖ
- [ ] NO ‚ùå (Need to revise research question)

### Step 5: Foundation Document Physical/Digital Check

**Verify you have active access:**
- [ ] Can I quickly access Mollick's Co-Intelligence document?
- [ ] Can I quickly access Swiss AI white paper?
- [ ] Can I quickly access The People Factor document?
- [ ] Are these documents uploaded/available in my cursor workspace?

### Step 6: Quick Foundation Refresh Test

**Without looking at documents, can you recall:**

**From Mollick** (1 point each):
- [ ] What are the 4 stages of AI collaboration?
- [ ] What does "co-intelligence" mean vs "artificial intelligence"?
- [ ] What is the key principle about human agency?

**From Swiss AI** (1 point each):
- [ ] What are 2 key ethical principles mentioned?
- [ ] What does "human-centered AI" mean in this context?
- [ ] What role should stakeholders play in AI development?

**From People Factor** (1 point each):
- [ ] What is the main argument about scaling AI tools?
- [ ] What factors determine successful AI adoption?
- [ ] How should AI success be measured?

**Foundation Knowledge Score: ___/9**

**Interpretation:**
- **8-9 points**: Strong foundation knowledge ‚úÖ
- **6-7 points**: Good foundation knowledge ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **4-5 points**: Need foundation review üîÑ
- **0-3 points**: Urgent foundation study needed ‚ùå

## Overall Foundation Integration Score

**Add up all scores:**
- Cursor Response Score: ___/12
