# Foundation Document Verification System

## How to Verify Your Foundation Documents Are Being Used

### Method 1: Direct Testing with Cursor

**Test Prompts** (Use these to verify cursor is referencing your documents):

```
"According to Ethan Mollick's framework in my foundation documents, what are the key principles of co-intelligence?"

"How does the Swiss AI white paper's approach to human-centered AI relate to my education research focus?"

"What specific measurement approaches does 'The People Factor' document suggest for human-AI collaboration?"

"Compare the three foundation documents' perspectives on trust in AI systems."
```

**Expected Response Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Specific citations or references to authors (Mollick, Swiss AI, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Detailed concepts that match your documents
- ‚úÖ Framework-specific terminology
- ‚ùå Generic AI responses without document-specific insights

### Method 2: Foundation Reference Tracker

**Daily Reference Check:**
Track when and how foundation documents influence your work:

| Date | Research Activity | Foundation Doc Used | Specific Concept/Page | How It Guided Decision |
|------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| [Date] | Survey design | Mollick Co-Intelligence | Trust calibration framework | Shaped trust measurement questions |
| [Date] | Pilot analysis | People Factor | Human-centered metrics | Influenced coding scheme |
| [Date] | Literature review | Swiss AI | Ethical considerations | Added ethics section |

### Method 3: Concept Mapping Verification

**Foundation Concept Integration Check:**

**From Ethan Mollick** - Are you using these core ideas?
- [ ] Co-intelligence as partnership, not replacement
- [ ] Four stages of AI interaction (Co-working, Co-creating, Co-teaching, Co-learning)
- [ ] Importance of human agency and control
- [ ] AI as amplifier of human capabilities

**From Swiss AI White Paper** - Are you integrating these principles?
- [ ] Human-centered AI development
- [ ] Transparency and explainability requirements
- [ ] Ethical AI implementation frameworks
- [ ] Stakeholder involvement in AI design

**From The People Factor** - Are you applying these approaches?
- [ ] Human-centered approach to scaling AI
- [ ] Focus on user experience and adoption
- [ ] Importance of training and support
- [ ] Measuring human impact, not just technical metrics

### Method 4: Research Question Alignment Check

**Verify your research questions stem from foundation documents:**

**Original Research Question**: [Your current question]
**Foundation Source**: [Which document inspired this]
**Specific Connection**: [Exact concept/framework that led to this question]
**Page/Section Reference**: [Where in the document]

**Example:**
- **Research Question**: "How do students calibrate trust when working with AI tutoring systems?"
- **Foundation Source**: Mollick's Co-Intelligence
- **Specific Connection**: Chapter on trust and AI partnership dynamics
- **Page/Section Reference**: [Chapter 3, trust calibration framework]

### Method 5: Weekly Foundation Audit

**Weekly Questions to Ask Yourself:**

1. **Relevance Check**: "Did I reference at least one foundation document this week?"
2. **Depth Check**: "Am I using specific frameworks, not just general ideas?"
3. **Integration Check**: "How did the foundation documents shape my research decisions?"
4. **Evolution Check**: "What new insights about the documents emerged from my research?"
5. **Gap Check**: "Are there parts of the foundation documents I'm not utilizing?"

### Method 6: Citation Tracking in Your Work

**Create a Foundation Citation Log:**

**Research Output**: [Paper, survey, interview protocol, etc.]
**Foundation References Used**:
- Mollick: [Specific concepts cited]
- Swiss AI: [Specific principles applied]  
- People Factor: [Specific approaches used]

**Total Foundation Citations**: [Number]
**Percentage of Work Grounded in Foundations**: [Estimate %]

### Method 7: Cursor Mode Verification Tests

**Monthly Test of Cursor Setup:**

Ask cursor these verification questions:

```
"Based on my foundation documents, critique this research approach: [describe your current method]"

"What would Mollick say about my current measurement of co-thinking effectiveness?"

"How do my findings align with or challenge the Swiss AI principles?"

"What aspects of The People Factor am I missing in my research design?"
```

**Strong Response Indicators:**
- Specific author references
- Document-accurate critiques
- Framework-based suggestions
- Integration across multiple foundation sources

### Method 8: Foundation Document Usage Dashboard

**Create a simple tracking system:**

```
FOUNDATION USAGE THIS WEEK:

Mollick Co-Intelligence:
üìñ Pages/chapters reviewed: [List]
üí° New insights gained: [List]
üîß Applied to research: [How]
‚ùì New questions raised: [What]

Swiss AI White Paper:
üìñ Sections reviewed: [List]
üí° New insights gained: [List]
üîß Applied to research: [How]
‚ùì New questions raised: [What]

The People Factor:
üìñ Sections reviewed: [List]
üí° New insights gained: [List]
üîß Applied to research: [How]
‚ùì New questions raised: [What]

INTEGRATION SCORE: [1-10, how well did I integrate all three this week?]
```

## Red Flags: When Foundation Documents Aren't Being Used

**Warning Signs:**
- ‚ùå Generic AI research without specific framework references
- ‚ùå Cursor responses that don't mention your foundation authors
- ‚ùå Research questions that could apply to any AI study
- ‚ùå Measurement tools that don't reflect foundation principles
- ‚ùå Analysis that doesn't connect back to foundation frameworks

## Recovery Actions When Foundation Use Is Low

**When you notice low foundation usage:**

1. **Re-read key sections** of foundation documents
2. **Update cursor custom mode** with more specific instructions
3. **Revise research questions** to be more foundation-specific
4. **Create foundation-based prompts** for your next research session
5. **Schedule weekly foundation review** time

## Success Metrics: Foundation Integration Working Well

**Green Light Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Research questions directly stem from foundation frameworks
- ‚úÖ Measurement tools reflect foundation principles
- ‚úÖ Analysis connects findings back to foundation theories
- ‚úÖ Cursor consistently references foundation documents
- ‚úÖ Your work couldn't be done without these specific documents
- ‚úÖ Other researchers can clearly see foundation influence in your work

**Goal**: Every major research decision should trace back to at least one foundation document!
