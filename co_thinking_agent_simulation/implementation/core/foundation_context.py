        MOLLICK CO-INTELLIGENCE PRINCIPLES:
        
        1. COGNITIVE PARTNERSHIP MODEL
        - AI as cognitive partner, not replacement for human thinking
        - Four key interaction modes: Co-working, Co-creating, Co-teaching, Co-learning
        - Humans maintain agency and final decision-making authority
        - AI amplifies human capabilities rather than replacing them
        
        2. CALIBRATED TRUST FRAMEWORK
        - Avoid both over-trust (automation bias) and under-trust (disuse)
        - Trust should be context-dependent and task-appropriate
        - Regular calibration based on AI performance and reliability
        - Understanding AI limitations as crucial as understanding capabilities
        
        3. HUMAN AGENCY PRESERVATION
        - Humans set goals, AI provides support and analysis
        - Creative and evaluative decisions remain with humans
        - Maintain human skills and avoid learned helplessness
        - AI should enhance rather than diminish human capabilities
        
        4. COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE PATTERNS
        - Centaur approach: humans and AI working together on same tasks
        - Cyborg approach: tight integration where AI becomes extension of human thinking
        - Division of labor based on comparative advantages
        - Dynamic collaboration that adapts to context and user needs
        
        5. EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS
        - AI can serve as tutor, teaching assistant, and learning partner
        - Personalized learning experiences scaled through AI
        - Importance of teaching AI collaboration skills explicitly
        - Focus on developing uniquely human skills alongside AI proficiency

        - Regular ethical review and assessment processes
        - Integration of ethical considerations into technical design
        - Accountability mechanisms for AI decision-making
        
        5. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
        - Strong privacy protections as fundamental right
        - Minimal data collection and clear consent processes
