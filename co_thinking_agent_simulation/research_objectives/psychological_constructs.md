# Core Psychological Constructs in Co-Thinking

## Overview

This document defines the five core psychological constructs that form the foundation of co-thinking research in educational AI contexts. Each construct represents a distinct but interrelated aspect of how humans develop cognitive partnerships with AI systems.

## 1. Cognitive Partnership

### Definition
**Cognitive Partnership** refers to the extent to which humans and AI systems work together as complementary cognitive agents, combining their respective strengths to achieve superior problem-solving and learning outcomes than either could accomplish independently.

### Theoretical Foundation
- **Distributed Cognition Theory**: Cognitive processes are distributed across individuals and technological tools
- **Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development**: AI serves as a "more knowledgeable other" that scaffolds learning
- **Mollick's Co-Intelligence**: Humans and AI as cognitive partners rather than human replacement

### Key Indicators
**Behavioral Manifestations**:
- Leveraging AI for tasks it excels at while maintaining human control over creative and evaluative decisions
- Seeking AI input for data analysis while providing human context and interpretation
- Using AI to generate multiple solution approaches while applying human judgment for selection
- Combining AI's computational capabilities with human intuition and experience

**Measurement Approaches**:
- **Think-aloud protocols**: Verbal expressions of collaborative reasoning
- **Task performance analysis**: Comparison of human-only vs. human-AI performance
- **Process tracing**: Documentation of when and how AI input is integrated
- **Self-report measures**: Perceived synergy and complementarity assessments

### Cultural Variations
- **Individualistic cultures**: May emphasize personal agency within the partnership
- **Collectivistic cultures**: May view AI as another member of a collaborative group
- **High power-distance cultures**: May treat AI as an authority figure to consult
- **Low power-distance cultures**: May view AI as an equal partner in problem-solving

### Developmental Patterns
- **Novice learners**: May rely heavily on AI without understanding complementarity
- **Intermediate learners**: Begin to recognize distinct strengths of human and AI cognition
- **Advanced learners**: Fluidly orchestrate human-AI collaboration for optimal outcomes
