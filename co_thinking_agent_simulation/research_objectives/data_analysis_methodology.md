- Response categories (appreciative, uncertain, etc.)
- Psychological constructs evident

#### Survey Response Records
Structured survey data including:
- Likert scale ratings with reasoning
- Parsed response themes
- Quality assessment metrics

### 🔍 Real-Time Analysis

Each response undergoes immediate analysis:

#### Response Quality Assessment
- **Coherence Analysis**: Sentence structure, logical flow, personal engagement
- **Cultural Consistency**: Alignment with agent's cultural background
- **Foundation Alignment**: Consistency with Mollick, Swiss AI, and People Factor principles
- **Linguistic Features**: Complexity matching English proficiency level

#### Psychological Construct Detection
Automatic identification of:
- **Cognitive Partnership**: Collaboration and teamwork language
- **Trust Calibration**: Trust and reliability indicators
- **Agency Distribution**: Control and decision-making references
- **Metacognitive Awareness**: Understanding and learning language
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Difficulty and effort indicators

#### Behavioral Pattern Recognition
- Question types (factual, help-seeking, confirmation, clarification)
- Emotional indicators (excitement, anxiety, confidence, confusion)
- Response categories (appreciative, uncertain, questioning, reflective)
